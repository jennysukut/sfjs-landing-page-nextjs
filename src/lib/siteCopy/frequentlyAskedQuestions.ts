    question: "What is AMS? How is it different than ATS?",
    answer: [
      "ATS stands for Application Tracking System. It’s a bit of a scary word around the job-market, but really it’s quite simple. It’s a helpful organization system where you can create and manage a job post. The software can publish your job listing on a variety of sites and draw thousands of candidates to your position. The system collects all applicant’s data and uses programs to look through those candidates and sort them based on relevant information. It then displays all the applications in order of relevance for hiring teams to review.",
      "ATS systems have dashboards where you can track statuses of all candidates and some even include legal and compliance help in the hiring process. Many offer additional services to help with paperwork and onboarding processes at an additional cost. ",
      "The not-so-well-kept secret about ATS is: they are often confusing and complex to navigate and most recruiters and hiring managers find them a nuisance. Not surprisingly, this is often by design. The ATS companies rely on the complex systems to drive businesses to spend more on higher priced plans that offer less frustration. More expensive plans often have more or “better” features and include things like courses or staff to help them navigate the complex systems. ",
      "The thing most hiring managers do appreciate about ATS, is its ability to efficiently and quickly organize + sort candidates. It also does a good job of managing and tracking applications. We took these aspects of the ATS and got rid of all the smoke and mirrors.",
      "Our AMS stands for Application Management System and it’s integrated seamlessly into our platform. The goal of our AMS is to foster simplicity and human connection in the hiring process. ",
      "Instead of handling thousands of resumes and using AI to sort them, we use pre-application filtering so all candidates that apply for a position meet minimum qualifications for the job. {and we believe most could do a pretty good job of it too} What this means is that you’ll have a simple dashboard with a maximum of 25-50 applications per job to be reviewed by human eyes. This realistic number of applicants mixed with a human-centric style of review makes for a simpler + more practical process. Our objective is to get you from a job opening to offer letters as quickly, efficiently, and kindly as possible. ",
      "And unlike most ATS, our AMS offers real-time updates to the candidate as well! This means that job seekers have ease-of-mind in the process, knowing their applications mean something. We keep them up to date on your behalf and, if you’d like, we make it super easy to personalize these updates, so the candidate knows that you care. Our AMS treats job seekers with respect and dignity and, by using it, that reputation extends to your business as well. Our AMS is there to make the process as simple and straightforward as possible so your business can get back to business. ",

    question:
      "What’s the deal with the colors? It doesn’t seem professional. Also, it isn’t ADA compliant.",
    answer: [
      "One of the first things people notice when they visit our site is the colors! We are all familiar with the standard design choices of most business websites and some might think we chose the colors we have out of a sense of whimsical naivete. We did put a solid dash of whimsy into the design, but the color palette is before all else, intentional. ",
      "In the online world, color play has been minimized in order to promote the idea of professionalism and utility. In addition to modern color choices, many sites have very busy windows. It has become the norm for our field of view to be packed with information, options, and advertising. This contributes to overstimulation and holds the underlying message that people’s attention is something to be monetized.",
      "We have chosen to go the opposite route. Our colors are not only whimsical and more fun to look at, but they are shades that hold meaning and promote happiness and calm. Shades of pink are proven to boost serotonin and have a calming effect on one’s nervous system. Shades of green are infused with peace and a tie to nature. And each of our color combinations is chosen because it captures an essence of positive energy - of life and nuance and depth and story.",
      "We double down on these positive effects by not capitalizing on screen space. We strive to simplify the information and direct your attention to one thing at a time. This helps promote the mental health of the people who frequent our platform!",
      "Some of you might notice that this color palette does not provide high contrast and is not ADA compliant. This is something we take seriously. So when we launch our platform, we will have an alternative version of the site with a delightfully bold and still playful color palette with higher contrast. There will be a nifty toggle switch that lets you use this version of the site that is custom made for the visually impaired. ",

    question:
      "Why do you call your employees/volunteers ‘makers’ and the job seekers ‘fellows’? Why not ‘employees’ and ‘users’?",
    answer: [
      "	The language we use shapes reality.*",
      "We understand that terms like ‘employee’ and ‘user’ are not inherently negative. They are utilitarian. They describe the relationship that a person has with a thing. It makes sense to say that a person who ‘uses’ a site should be called a ‘user’. It is descriptive. However, there is so much more to a person than that.",
      "What’s more, when we describe and categorize people based on their actions, it can be easier to disassociate them from their humanity. ‘User’ does not describe a person, it describes a single action that they take. Often, within software companies, when the term ‘user’ comes up, it is related to statistics, numbers, and money. The ‘user’ then gets held up to be scrutinized in direct relation to profits. The person behind the number gets lost, and sometimes their rights and value as a person can get lost too. ",
      "We like to associate the people on our site with a positive term that helps us keep their humanity in mind. We settled on the term ‘fellow’ because of its whimsy and wholesome connection to personhood.** We hope it catches on!",
      "Likewise, we call our employees ‘makers’ because we believe that describes our relationship with them a little better. They are the reason that this site and service exists. Without them here to ‘make’ this site, it wouldn’t happen. That extends beyond the software developers. Any member of our business is there to make sure we can offer this service, and so, at the very center of this Straightforward Job Site, each and every one of them is making it a reality.",
      "*Here is a cool study about this: https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/language-changes-color/",
      "**Also, not gonna lie, “fellow” does harken back to “fellowship” and any good LOTR fan finds a way to slip tolkeinesque terms into anything they create.",

  {
    question: "How can you ensure the job posts are real and active?",
    answer: [
      "We have a very common-sense + practical requirement that all jobs posted on our site are to be actively hiring. The way this plays out is that all companies are required to review applications and move forward in hiring stages during the time their post is active. If, after one month of listing, businesses are not opening and reviewing applications or moving onto next stages, their post gets renewed at double price and then triple price the following month. After 3 months of inactivity, a post will be deleted.",
      "What’s more, since we do not share any personal information like emails & phone numbers with anyone else, companies and scammers would have nothing to gain from this kind of dishonesty. There is no data to mine or scrape - just people looking for employment and honesty in the world. There are not many companies or individuals who would be willing to pay so much money to have a scam accumulating dust.",

  {
    question: "How can you promise no-ghosting?",
    answer: [
      "Ending ghosting is simple. In fact it’s so simple, you’ll start to wonder why other services haven’t done this already…",
      "We simply build rules into our platform, the way you do with passwords and security. When a business posts a job, if they want to select candidates to move onto the next stage in the Application Manager, it will require them to send rejection messages to the other candidates. If they don’t, they won't be able to proceed.",
      "If they don’t have the time to craft a personal response, we will offer several templates for them to choose from. And if they refuse to do even this, then we will send a rejection message to candidates on their behalf. We feel a response is the bare minimum a person deserves.",

    question:
      "What’s with the crowdfunding? Why not just seek Venture Capital?",
    answer: [
      "We are attempting to build something profoundly intentional. This is not a business we hope to grow and grow and grow until we can sell for lots of money. We want to fix a problem and facilitate health. We want to be one piece in a movement that makes life better for people.",
      "We know that this idea has the potential to be very successful and become a disruptor to the status quo. One thing that often happens to companies that are potential disruptors is that they get acquired before they can make a difference or become a competitor on the national stage. We want to prevent a future where we might be forced to sell or to be publicly traded. Any small concession can be used as potential inroads to bring this about.",
      "We want to build a company that prioritizes people and is not beholden to a group of shareholders whose main interest is profit. We believe maintaining 100% ownership is the clearest path to that future.",
      "This means we are building this the hard way. Many members of our volunteer group are unemployed. They need a job board like this as much as anybody else. Any expenses we incur are coming right out of our small standard-human-sized pockets. Our volunteers understand our desires and are willing to give their time to help because they are just as passionate about making a better way for hiring. ",
      "That is why we are asking people for help through crowdfunding. We are hoping to raise enough money to help pay our volunteers and help cover bills until we can offer them employment or assistance with their own entrepreneurial dreams.",

  {
    question: "Why have Pay-What-You-Want? Why not just make it free?",
    answer: [
      "We understand what a financial burden most everyone holds during their job search. We want to lift that burden from people who are without an income, because the process is hard enough as it is.",
      "By introducing a PWYW pay wall, we are communicating that our platform has real value. This is especially true for job seekers, since we offer benefits that they cannot find anywhere else. Our site will contribute significantly to saving their time and money, and it will relieve lots of stress and anxiety in the process. Job seekers will always have the option to access all the benefits of our site for free if they choose! We are not stingy with the help we want to give people and the kindness we want to see more of in the world.",
      "However, by giving people the option to pay for our services, we acknowledge that we have a quality product that is made and maintained by real people who put real value, time, energy, and effort into the site. It gives the people who do have the room in their budget the ability to pay for those services and show their support for our mission and crew.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question:
      "Will the price change? Maybe you will start charging job seekers later, or start to offer sponsored posts when you get bigger.",
    answer: [
      "We are committed to the missions and values that are set forth on our current site. We aren’t going to offer price changes or any tiered services to businesses or job-seekers on our platform.",
      "We promise that this site will always be available to job seekers with all its features pay-what-you-want. {Seriously, take a screenshot of this and sue us if we don’t stand by that promise.}",
      "	In addition, we don’t see a need for any kind of sponsored posts in the future. With our system, we don’t need to make things more complicated or monetize our own simplicity. We’re just here to facilitate human hiring, and with the right rules in place, that’ll be easy for everyone.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question:
      "Is it possible to find a perfect candidate in 25-50 applications?",
    answer: [
      "A candidate pool of 25-50 people might seem far fetched in today's hiring world. The key to the success of this feature is that the 25-50 candidates that apply to the job are qualified and interested candidates. The candidates can only apply to a position if they match with the minimum requirements in the job description, as set by the business. When you couple this with the fact that we only allow job seekers to apply to five job posts a day, it fosters a sense of intentionality. Job-seekers won’t be incentivized to “spray and pray,” rather, we find they’ll be able to carefully consider the available job opportunities and select ones that suit them before applying. ",
      "The intentionality from the job seeker and the small pool of qualified candidates ensures that the profiles you see in the application pool are going to be a good match for the job. And, if they aren’t, all you have to do is send off rejections and move on to the second round of gathering applications at no extra cost.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question:
      "Why are you making us ditch the resumes? Why not just give us the option?",
    answer: [
      "The reality is: resumes are outdated. In a time where you needed a piece of paper to represent you and all your accomplishments, it was a nifty tool. But now is not that time and we aren’t lacking ways to share information. We are able to share more in a better and simpler way, a way that takes the confusion + mystery out of the process and levels the playing field for everyone. In a world where resumes are starting to mean very little, except to create some busy work for AI, we decided to scrap them and move past it. Instead, we allow job seekers to build profiles with special categories that have all the information you’d want from a resume and more.",
      "This means the job seeker doesn’t have to spend hours and hours writing and rewriting a document that, let’s face it, isn’t the best representation of who they are and what they bring to the table. They don’t have to enter the same information on page after page and on different websites. Instead, they can decide to share who they are and be represented in a wholesome way that doesn’t need to be changed with each application they submit. ",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Will the site only be available in the US?",
    answer: [
      "Straightforward Job Site will be available worldwide. When we launch our MVP, we will be available in English, but accessible from any country. We plan to bring in some fantastic translators to make our site available in every language as soon as we are able. ",
